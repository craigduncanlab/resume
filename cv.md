# LEGAL CAREER

I have over twenty years legal experience in the corporate sector, providing advice to banks, resources companies, ASX-listed companies, property management entities, landlords, indigenous organisations, small businesses and individuals.

Beginning my legal career at Mallesons Stephen Jaques in 1995, I worked in corporate advisory and commercial litigation for 5 years, before taking on a newly created role as an-house lawyer for Taylor Woodings (now FTI Consulting) specialising in corporate insolvency, including advising liquidators on ATO appointments.  

I have since worked as an independent barrister, and conducted my own legal practice.

My legal advice has covered a broad range of commercial matters including civil litigation, contract law, intellectual property, Corporations Act and corporate governance, corporate insolvency and external administrations, commercial leases, mergers and acquisitions, mining business structures, land use agreements, distribution agreements, mortgages and loans, business sale transactions, capital infrastructure for mining projects, derivatives contracts (ISDA), ATO debt disputes, environmental issues and employment law.
